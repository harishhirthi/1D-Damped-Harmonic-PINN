# 1D-Damped-Harmonic-PINN
Neural Network to solve Scientific and Engineering applications.

## Description:
To learn the basics of Neural Networks that solve problems related to Physics and Engineering. These type of Networks are known as **Physics-Informed Neural Networks(PINN)**, 
a part of ***Scientific Machine Learning(SciML)***. It solves these scientific problems by using known underlying *classical physics equations[ODE and PDE]* of that problem and also with *limited data*. In this example, PINN is used to predict damped 1-D Harmonic oscillation.
